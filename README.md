# Klayopt

A simple keyboard layout optimizer.

The goal of this tool is to brute force possible character combinations in a
keyboard layout to find ways of reducing uncomfortable digrams.

Right now, there is *no* user interface : if you want to change some
parametters, you’ll need to tinker the source code and recompile.

This program is written in Rust, so to run a test, it’s as simple as cloning
this repo, and running `cargo run`.
